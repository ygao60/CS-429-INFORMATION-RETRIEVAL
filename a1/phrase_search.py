""" Assignment 1

You will modify Assignment 0 to support phrase queries instead of AND queries.

The documents are read from documents.txt.
The queries to be processed are read from queries.txt.

Assume all multi-word queries are phrase queries. E.g., the query "why did
the" should be processed as a phrase, not a conjunction.

In addition, you will modify the tokenize method to keep hyphens and
apostrophes inside words, as well as add a stem method to collapse the terms
"did" and "does" to "do."  (More details are in the comments of each method.)

Finally, complete the find_top_bigrams method to find the most frequent
bigrams of (normalized) terms in the document set.

    Your implementation should be linear in the length of the number of
    positions in each list. That is, you should access each position value at
    most once.

    In the example below, word1 occurs in document 0 (positions 1,4), document
    1 (position 0), and document 10 (positions 2, 3, 4). Word2 occurs in
    document 0 (positions 2, 6), document 1 (position 2), document 2 (position
