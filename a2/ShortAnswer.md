Edit this file and push to your private repository to provide answers to the following questions.

1. In `searcher.py`, why do we keep an inverted index instead of simply a list
of document vectors (e.g., dicts)? What is the difference in time and space
complexity between the two approaches?

    **Insert your answer here.**

2. Consider the query `chinese` with and without using champion lists.  Why is
the top result without champion lists absent from the list that uses champion
lists? How can you alter the algorithm to fix this?

    **Insert your answer here.**

3. Describe in detail the data structures you would use to implement the
Cluster Pruning approach, as well as how you would use them at query time.

    **Insert your answer here.**
