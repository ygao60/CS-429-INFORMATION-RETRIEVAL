(15810) 1994 JR1, also written as 1994 JR1, is a plutino, with 2:3 resonance with Neptune, similar to Pluto. It has a perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) at 34.756 AU and an aphelion (farthest distance from the Sun) at 44.507[2], so it is in a relatively eccentric orbit. It is about 127 km in diameter[2], so it is unlikely to be classified as a dwarf planet due to its relatively small size. It was discovered on May 12, 1994 by M. J. Irwin and A. Zytkow.[3]

Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (July 17, 1714 – May 26, 1762) was a German philosopher. Baumgarten was born in Berlin as the fifth of seven sons of the pietist pastor of the garrison, Jacob Baumgarten and his wife Rosina Elisabeth. Both his parents died early and he was taught by Martin Georg Christgau where he learned Hebrew and got interested in Latin Poetry. Whilst words may change their meaning through cultural developments anyway, Baumgarten's reappraisal of aesthetics is often seen as the key moment in the development of aesthetic philosophy. Previously the word had merely meant 'sensibility' or 'responsiveness to stimulation of the senses' in its use by ancient writers. With the development of art as a commercial enterprise linked to the rise of a nouveau riche class across Europe, the purchasing of art inevitably lead to the question, 'what is good art'. Baumgarten developed aesthetics to mean the study of good and bad "taste," thus good and bad art, linking good taste with beauty.

Anti-Zionism is opposition to Zionism, an international political movement and ideology that supports a Homeland for the Jewish People in Israel (in the dominant interpretations, based on the creation of a Jewish majority).[1] Opposition to Zionism takes on a spectrum of religious, ethical, or political forms, including: opposition to the creation of a Jewish state prior to the appearance of the messiah, objection to the idea of a state based on maintenance of a Jewish majority (i.e. Israel's demographic aspects), non-violent rejection of the Israeli right to govern other peoples in the region (i.e. Jewish nationalist hegemony over Arab indigenes), and/or violent confrontation of Israel's right to exist in any form (i.e. a quest for its physical annihilation). Anti-Zionists can be either left-wing or right-wing, religious or secular, Jewish or Gentile. Because anti-Zionism and antisemitism are at times associated, and as both terms can mean different things to different people, the relationship between the two is controversial.

	    The Areopagite constitution is the modern name for a period in ancient Athens described by Aristotle in his Constitution of the Athenians. According to that work, the Athenian political scene was dominated, between the ostracism of Themistocles in the late 470s BC and the reforms of Ephialtes in 462 BC, by the Areopagus, a traditional court composed of former archons.[1] Modern scholars have debated the existence of this phenomenon, with some concluding that Aristotle and his contemporaries invented it to explain Ephialtes' need to limit the Areopagus' powers,[2] and arguing that the lack of concrete measures establishing the Areopagus' dominance shows that the Areopagite constitution is "palpably unhistorical".[3] Other scholars, such as Donald Kagan, have countered that no concrete measures were necessary, as the Areopagus' dominance was established not through actual changes in the laws but through the prestige of its leading members.[4] Aristotle specifically cites the Areopagites' distribution of money to the public as the citizen body prepared to abandon Athens in the face of the advancing Persian army.[5]

Barbed tape or Razor Wire is a mesh of metal strips with sharp edges whose purpose is to prevent passage by humans. The name "Razor Wire" is a registered trademark of Allied Tube &amp; Conduit Company, although through long usage the term is generally used to describe the barbed tape products of other manufacturers. Whilst razor wire is much sharper than the barbs of standard barbed wire, it is not actually razor sharp. Even so, the multiple bladed edges of a razor wire fence are designed to inflict serious cuts on anyone who attempts to climb through one, and therefore have a strong psychological deterrent effect. In high security applications, barbed tape supplanted barbed wire, which could be circumvented relatively quickly by humans without tools. In contrast, getting past razor wire barriers without tools is very slow and difficult, giving security forces more time to respond. There is little difference in the breaching time for a well equipped opponent.[citation needed]

Because of their penchant for high altitudes and low temperatures, they are rarely sighted by humans, but sometimes help shepherds round up lost sheep. Their greatest known excitement is surfing on avalanches with their remarkably large feet, but they are said to give low whistling cries to warn humans of the danger above, sometimes they will give their best effort to dig humans out from the snow.[1]

	    Beniamino Segre (16 February 1903-2 October 1977) was an Italian mathematician who is remembered today as a major contributor to algebraic geometry and one of the founders of combinatorial geometry. He was born and studied in Turin. His main contributions to algebraic geometry concerned birational invariants of algebraic varieties, and the investigation of singularities. This work was in the style of the old Italian School, although he also appreciated the need for greater rigour characteristic of modern algebraic geometry. But his more original contribution was the introduction of finite and non-continuous structures into geometry. In his best known paper (On ovals in finite projective planes, 1954) he proved the following theorem: In a Desarguesian plane of odd order, the ovals are exactly the irreducible conics. Some critics felt that his work was no longer geometry, but today it is recognized as a separate subdiscipline: combinatorial geometry.

	    Birtha (Greek: Βίρθα, Ptol. v. 18; Virta, Amm. Marc. xx. 7. § 17) was an ancient fortress on the Tigris to the south of Mesopotamia, which was said to have been built by Alexander the Great. It would seem, from the description of Ammianus (l. c.), to have resembled a modern fortification, flanked by bastions, and with its approaches defended by out-works. Sapor here closed his campaign in 360, and was compelled to retire with considerable loss. D'Anville (Geog. Anc. vol. ii. p. 416) identifies this place with modern-day Tikrit, Iraq, in which Gibbon (vol. iii. p. 205) agrees with him. The word "Birtha" in Syriac means a castle or fortress, and might be applied to many places. From the known position of Dura, it has been inferred that the remarkable passage of the Tigris by Jovian in 363 took place near Tikrit. (Amm. Marc. xxv. 6. § 12; Zosim. iii. 26.) Towards the end of the 14th century, this impregnable fortress was stormed by Timour-Leng. The ruins of the castle are on a perpendicular cliff over the Tigris, about 200 feet (65 m) high. This insulated cliff is separated from the town by a broad and deep ditch, which was no doubt filled by the Tigris. At the foot of the castle is a large gate of brick-work, which is all that remains standing; but round the summit of the cliff the walls, buttresses, and bastions are quite traceable. There are the ruins of a vaulted secret staircase, leading down from the heart of the citadel to the water's edge. (Rich, Kurdistan, vol. ii. p. 147; comp. Journ. Geog. Soc. vol. ix. p. 448; Chesney, Exped. Euphrat. vol. i. pp. 26, 27; Ritter, Erdkunde, vol. x. p. 222.)

In aeronautical engineering, boundary layer control (BLC) refers to a number of methods of controlling the boundary layer of air on the main wing of an aircraft. In doing so, parasitic drag can be greatly reduced and performance likewise increased, while the usable angle of attack can be greatly increased, thereby dramatically improving lift at slow speeds. An aircraft with a boundary layer control system thus has greatly improved performance over a similar plane without such a system, often offering the otherwise contradictory features of STOL performance and high cruising speeds.

	    The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that conducts signals from the spine to the shoulder, arm and hand. Brachial plexus injuries are caused by damage to those nerves. Symptoms may include a limp or paralyzed arm, lack of muscle control in the arm, hand, or wrist, and lack of feeling or sensation in the arm or hand. Although injuries can occur at any time, many brachial plexus injuries happen during birth: the baby's shoulders may become impacted during the birth process causing the brachial plexus nerves to stretch or tear. There are several different classification systems for grading the severity of peripheral nerve and brachial plexus injuries. The most common system divides nerve injuries into five degrees (described by Sir Sydney Sunderland): first degree or neurapraxia, in which the insulation around the nerve called myelin is damaged but the nerve itself is spared, and second through fifth degree, which denotes increasing severity of injury. With fifth degree injuries, the nerve is completely divided. Although several mechanisms account for brachial plexus injuries, the most common is nerve compression or stretch. Infants, in particular, may suffer brachial plexus injuries during delivery and these present with typical patterns of weakness, depending on which portion of the brachial plexus is involved. The most severe form of injury is nerve root avulsion, which results in complete weakness in corresponding muscles. This usually accompanies high-velocity impacts that occurs during motor vehicle or bicycle accidents.

The California Kingsnake (Lampropeltis getulus californiae) originates in the desert, yet can live in many other places, such as woodland, farm land, forests and riversides. Among pet-snake owners, they are very popular. They usually reach four to six feet in length in adulthood. They usually live from 15 to 20 years in captivity, but have been known to live longer. The California Kingsnake is most commonly black with white transverse bands (though yellow bands are recorded in some varieties), with a checkered stomach and black eyes. Kingsnakes usually shed 4 to 6 times a year, at which point they go "opaque". The term "Opaque" means the snake's skin becomes dull and her eyes will turn a milky color. They usually shed in one long piece, which includes their eye scales. Adolescent snakes will shed more than adult snakes because they grow faster. When a kingsnake is preparing to shed, it needs a humid environment to help shed the old skin. While this process is occurring, the snake should be handled as little as possible, as the new skin is not yet mature and could be injured.

	    Dalgaranga crater is a small meteorite impact crater located on Dalgaranga pastoral station 75 km west of Mount Magnet (or north of Yalgoo) in Western Australia. It is only 24 m in diameter and 3 m deep, making it Australia's smallest impact crater (with exception of the smallest members of the Henbury crater field).[1] Though reputedly discovered much earlier, it was first reported in the scientific literature in 1938.[2] The bedrock at the site is weathered Archaean granite of the Yilgarn Craton. The discovery of fragments of mesosiderite stony-iron meteorite around the crater confirms an impact origin,[3] making this crater unique as the only one known to have been produced by a mesosiderite projectile. Asymmetries in the crater structure and the ejecta blanket imply that the projectile impacted at low angle from the south-southeast.[4] The age is not accurately constrained by must be young because it is so well preserved for its small size, and the meteorite fragments have not weathered away; some authors suggest an age of as young as 3000 years.

The Donation of Constantine (Latin, Donatio Constantini)[1] is a forged Roman imperial edict devised probably between 750 and 775. The earliest date is the most probable. It is often said that the document could have been written around 752. Albert Hauck suggested in 1888[2] that assuming that the document was forged shortly before the Council of Quierzy, 754, would explain demands made by the Pope on that occasion, "demands which had no basis in law or fact", commented F. Zinkeisen.[3] The earliest secure allusion to the Donatio is in a letter in which Pope Hadrian I exhorts Charlemagne to follow Constantine's example and endow the Roman church. It was clearly a defense of papal interests, perhaps against the claims of either the Byzantine Empire, or the Frankish king Charlemagne, who had assumed the former imperial dignity in the West and with it the title "Emperor of the Romans". The Donation is included among the texts of the False Decretals of Isidore.

	    Classic drum and bugle corps are North American musical ensembles that descended from military bugle and drum units returning from World War I and succeeding wars. Traditionally, drum and bugle corps served as signaling units as early as before the American Civil War, with these signaling units having descended in some fashion from ancient drum and fife corps. With the advent of the radio, bugle signaling units became obsolete and surplus equipment was sold to veteran organizations (such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion, two major organizers for classic drum corps). These organizations formed drum and bugle corps of civilians and veterans, and the corps performed in community events and local celebrations. Over time, rivalries between corps emerged and the competitive drum and bugle corps circuit evolved.

The Edrioasteroids are an extinct class of echinoderm that lived from the Ediacaran (if Arkarua was indeed an edrioaster) to the Permian periods of geologic time, about 600-300&#160;million years ago. The animals usually consisted of a disk-like upper body made of many plates. The body plan for this class was simple: a main body (theca), composed of many small plates, a peripheral rim for attachment, and (in some species) a pedunculate zone for extension and retraction. Circling and sometimes attached to the body was a peripheral rim of plates. The main feature is the five arms called ambulacra that are contained in the body area radiating from the mouth in the center of the body outwards. The arms grow in a spiral pattern, sometimes in the same direction. The anus is situated under the mouth region and is made of small triangular plates to form a cone-shaped area. Edrioasteroid species are distinguished by differences in the ambulacral curvature and the plating covering the ambulacra and the mouth. The mode of life was sessile; they were often attached via a stalk made of small plates to a hard object such as a carbonate hardground or shell.

The Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis) is a carnivorous mammal of the family Canidae. It is also known as the Abyssinian wolf, red jackal, red fox, Simien fox or Simien jackal). The numerous names reflect previous uncertainty about its taxonomic position, but it is now thought to be related to the wolves of the genus Canis rather than the foxes it superficially resembles. The Ethiopian wolf is found in the Afro-alpine regions of Ethiopia, about 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) above sea level. It is the most endangered canid,[3] with only about seven populations remaining, totalling roughly 550 adults. The largest population is found in the Bale Mountains in southern Ethiopia, although there are also smaller populations in the Simien Mountains in the north of the country, and in a few other areas. Claudio Sillero-Zubiri at the University of Oxford is the zoologist most closely associated with efforts to save this species of wolf, particularly with his work for an oral rabies vaccine to protect them from the disease passed from local dogs. His work is supported by the Born Free Foundation. A rabies outbreak in 1990 reduced the largest known population, found in the Bale Mountains National Park, from about 440 wolves to less than 160 in only two weeks.

	    Étienne Boileau (1200 or 1210 – April 1270), was one of the first known provosts of Paris. In 1261, he was named provost (1261 – 1271),by King Louis IX. He authored the Goldsmiths' Statute of 1260, a collection of the statutes of the Parisian trade guilds, including the standards for gold and silver alloys. Boileau brought together the regulations on the police, industry and the trades of Paris in this “Book of the Trades.” This work in prose is a faithful mirror reflecting the smallest details of the industrial and commercial life of Paris in the 13th century. The work is the oldest document on the legislation of the communities of craftsmen in France, written in 1268. Jean de Joinville draws a very flattering portrait of Boileau in his History of St. Louis. According to Joinville, Boileau was a just man without undue consideration for the wealth or status of the accused, and thus disencumbered the city of all its robbers and criminals.

	    Fallstreak holes are large circular gaps that can appear in cirrocumulus or altocumulus clouds. The holes are formed when the water temperature in the clouds is below freezing but the water has not frozen yet. Due to not completely understood processes this water will remain in a liquid state almost indefinitely. When a portion of the water does start to freeze it will set of a domino effect causing the water vapor around it to freeze and fall to the earth as well. This leaves large circular holes in the cloud.[1]

	    A fauchard is a type of polearm which was used in medieval Europe from the 11th through the 14th centuries. The design consisted of a curved blade put atop a 2 m (6-7 feet) long pole. The blade bore a moderate to strong curve along its length, however unlike a glaive the cutting edge was only on the concave side. This made the fauchard blade resemble that of a sickle or a scythe. This was not a very efficient design for the purposes of war, and was eventually modified to have one or more lance points attached to the back or top of the blade. This weapon is called a fauchard-fork, but is very often erroneously referred to as a guisarme or bill-guisarme since it superficially appears to have a 'hook'.

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal, incurable disease that affects cats. It is believed by some to be caused by Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV), which is a mutation of Feline Enteric Coronavirus (FECV/FeCoV). Although there appears to be a connection between FIP and feline coronavirus, no clear cause and effect has yet been proven. Experts do not always agree on the specifics of FIP. However, the most common theory is that the normally benign FECV mutates into FIPV. The mutated virus has the ability to invade and grow in certain white blood cells, namely macrophages. The immune system's response causes an intense inflammatory reaction in the containing tissues. This disease is generally fatal [1]. However its incidence rate is roughly 1 in 5000 for households with one or two cats. [2]

The female reproductive system contains two main parts: the vagina and uterus, which act as the receptacle for the male's sperm, and the ovaries, which produce the female's ova. All of these parts are always internal; the vagina meets the outside at the vulva, which also includes the labia, clitoris and urethra. The vagina is attached to the uterus through the cervix, while the uterus is attached to the ovaries via the Fallopian tubes. At certain intervals, the ovaries release an ovum, which passes through the fallopian tube into the uterus.

The smaller scale meant that quite comprehensive circuits could be fitted on to an 8' x 4' baseboard, but generally, electrical conductivity was quite fragile, so many users adopted a practice of a second conductor track piece on the far side of the circuit.

With an area of 1,760,000 square kilometers and a Mediterranean coastline of nearly 1,800 kilometers, Libya is fourth in size among the countries of Africa and seventeenth among the countries of the world. It lies between Egypt and Tunisia. Although the oil discoveries of the 1960s have brought it immense petroleum wealth, at the time of its independence it was an extremely poor desert state whose only important physical asset appeared to be its strategic location at the midpoint of Africa's northern rim. It lay within easy reach of the major European nations and linked the Arab countries of North Africa with those of the Middle East, facts that throughout history had made its urban centers bustling crossroads rather than isolated backwaters without external social influences. Consequently, an immense social gap developed between the cities, cosmopolitan and peopled largely by foreigners, and the desert hinterland, where tribal chieftains ruled in isolation and where social change was minimal.

	    Geoponici (the Latinized form of a nonexistent Γεωπονικοι, used for convenience), or Scriptores rei rusticae, the Greek and Roman writers on husbandry and agriculture. On the whole the Greeks paid less attention than the Romans to the scientific study of these subjects, which in classical times they regarded as a branch of economics. Thus Xenophon's Oeconomicus (see also Memorabilia ii.4) contains a eulogy of agriculture and its beneficial ethical effects, and much information is to be found in the writings of Aristotle and his pupil Theophrastus. About the same time as Xenophon, the philosopher Democritus of Abdera wrote a treatise Περι Γεωργιας ("On Agriculture"), frequently quoted and much used by the later compilers of Geoponica (agricultural treatises). Greater attention was given to the subject in the Alexandrian period; a long list of names is given by Varro and Columella, amongst them Hiero II and Attalus III Philometor. Later, Cassius Dionysius of Utica translated and abridged the great work of the Carthaginian Mago, which was still further condensed by Diophanes of Nicaea in Bithynia for the use of King Deiotarus. From these and similar works, Cassianus Bassus compiled his Geoponica, a source of the later Byzantine Geoponica. Mention may also be made of a little work Περι Γεωργικων by Michael Psellus.

He was best known for his delicate sonnets, such as the Song of the Wave, Essex, and Trumbull Stickney (Stickney was a friend and admirer), several of which were anthologized. His style and artistic outlook were deeply effected by the pessimism of Schopenhauer and Giacomo Leopardi, as well as French influences including Baudelaire and Leconte de Lisle.

State Route 138 Spur is a very short route, about one-half mile in length, in Jonesboro that connects S.R. 138 with U.S. 19, U.S. 41, S.R. 3, and S.R. 54 (Tara Boulevard). Until the early 1990s, it was part of S.R. 138 proper, which ran through downtown Jonesboro at the time. Around that time, a new bypass was built around the north side of the city. It initially received the designation 138 Spur; however, once the bypass was completed, the 138 and 138 Spur designations were swapped and the new 138 Spur truncated to Tara Boulevard on the west side of Jonesboro. Some street signs on the northern bypass, now the S.R. 138 mainline, still anachronistically refer to the road as "Spur 138".

	    Girneys are vocalizations - similar to human Baby Talk - used by adult female Rhesus Monkeys to establish friendly contact with infant monkeys who are not their own offspring. The vocalizations are made in a high-pitched sing-song. Dario Maestripieri, associate professor of comparative human development at the University of Chicago, says the sounds are "made with their mouths almost closed, sort of nasal and relatively soft." Professor Mastripieri suggests that the similarity of girneys to human Baby Talk suggests that the latter may be of biological origin. The research was made mostly by Maestripieri's PhD student Jessica Whitman, who observed 19 adult females in a family of 65 Rhesus Monkeys on the island of Cayo Santiago near Puerto Rico, every day for several months in 2004 and 2005. Melissa Gerald of the University of Puerto Rico was the third co-author of the paper, which was published in the journal Ethology, August 24, 2007. Adult males - who take no part in raising the young - do not use the girneys. Mothers never use them with their own children. The vocalization is often accompanied by tail-wagging, a very rare behavior.

This differs from just opening the doors on the first day due to a Grand Opening being more of a celebration event, not just the first day having the doors open for clients. Often the opening announcements are in this order: Coming Soon, Now Open, and then Grand Opening. The first two of these announcements are meant to communicate to the targeted clients that there is an intent to serve them. Whereupon the Grand Opening is stating that there is a special event planned. Often this is achieved with a party type atmosphere such as: food, music, prizes, balloons, give always, festive signs, searchlights lighting up the night sky, fireworks display, etc... It is often suggested that an organization not have a Grand Open the very first day they open their doors; unless that organization is a well established already. Often an organization will have a "soft opening" first. This means to open the doors with out a lot of attention. This allows the organization to become more organized the first few weeks or months they are open. In this way the management and staff have a chance to become familiar with the daily operations of their inventory, accounting, and customer service requirements needed to be efficient with the clients requirements. Once the organization is organized and ready to receive larger amounts of clients, they will then sponsor a Grand Opening event. Some will use hanging banners, colorful posters, bright signs, post card mailings, newspaper articles or radio and television ads to attract as much attention as possible to this celebration. Still others go a bit further and have a ribbon cutting ceremony, where an over sized pair of scissors is used to cut an over sized ribbon to "officially" open their doors. No matter how the organization chooses to announce their Grand Opening, it should be viewed as a promotional way to state that they are completely ready to serve their clients needs in a proficient and professional manner.
The Grand Slam in men's golf is an unofficial concept, having changed over time. In the modern era, The Grand Slam is generally considered to be winning all four of golf's major championships in the same calendar year.

No man has ever achieved a modern grand slam, Tiger Woods being the closest in winning all four consecutively, but over two calendar years.

The Great Sioux Reservation was established in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, and includes all of modern Western South Dakota (commonly known as "West River" South Dakota) and modern Boyd County, Nebraska. This area was established as a reservation for the Teton Sioux, also known as the Lakota: the seven western bands of the "Seven Council Fires" (the Great Sioux Nation). In addition to the reservation dedicated to the Lakota, they also reserved the right to hunt and travel in "unceded" territory in much of Wyoming and the Sandhills and Panhandle of modern Nebraska. Because each band had its own preferred area, a series of agencies were established for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to regulate the Lakota in this vast area. The Missouri River formed the eastern boundary of the Reservation, which included some land already allocated to other tribes, such as the Ponca. This land was, however, the center of the Lakota Nation and had been since their discovery of the Black Hills (Lakota name: Paha Sapa) in 1765 and their conquest of the Black Hills from the Cheyenne Indians in 1776.

	    The Green River of Tennessee is one of the main streams of Wayne County. Wayne County, in the southwestern corner of Middle Tennessee along the Alabama line, is one of the state's largest counties in area but is very sparsely populated. Most of the county is located on the Southern Highland Rim, an area of hills, ridges, and narrow stream valleys that is largely underlain by Paleozoic limestone. The Green River rises about seven miles southeast of the Wayne County seat of Waynesboro and flows northwest into that town, which is almost bisected by it, and then flows generally almost due north, albeit by a fairly meandering course, to its confluence with the Buffalo River just south of the Wayne County - Perry County line. It is the source of the Waynesboro municipal water supply. The river lives up to its name, often showing a deep bluish-green color, especially in its downstream reaches. The area it drains, while perhaps not spectacular, nonetheless is very scenic, with many small waterfalls and cascades and numerous springs.

	    In theoretical physics, a hierarchy problem occurs when the fundamental parameters (couplings or masses) of some Lagrangian are vastly different (usually larger) than the parameters measured by experiment. This can happen because measured parameters are related to the fundamental parameters by a prescription known as renormalization. Typically the renormalized parameters are closely related to the fundamental parameters, but in some cases, it appears that there has been a delicate cancellation between the fundamental quantity and the quantum corrections to it. Hierarchy problems are related to fine-tuning problems and problems of naturalness.

Ptolemaic Egypt began when Ptolemy I Soter declared himself Pharaoh of Egypt in 305 BC and ended with the death of queen Cleopatra of Egypt and the Roman conquest in 30 BC. The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state, extending from southern Syria in the east, to Cyrene to the west, and south to the frontier with Nubia. Alexandria became the capital city and a center of Greek culture and trade. To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace, they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs. The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions by marrying their siblings, had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participated in Egyptian religious life.[1][2] Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest. The Ptolemies had to fight native rebellions and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome.

	    In mathematics, a hypergeometric series is a power series in which the ratios of successive coefficients k is a rational function of k. The series, if convergent, will define a hypergeometric function which may then be defined over a wider domain of the argument by analytic continuation. Hypergeometric functions generalize many special functions, including the Bessel functions, the incomplete Gamma function, the error function, the elliptic integrals and the orthogonal polynomials. This is in part because the hypergeometric functions are solutions to the hypergeometric differential equation, which is a fairly general second-order ordinary differential equation.

	    The Indian Oil Cup 2005 was a three-team cricket tournament which took place in Sri Lanka in July and August 2005, between the hosts Sri Lanka, India and West Indies. Sri Lanka were second in the ICC ODI Championship before this tournament, and fulfilled their position as favourites with an 18-run victory over India in the final. Their last ODI tournament defeat at home was a 2-3 series loss to Australia, in February 2004. India, meanwhile, continued on their disappointing run, as that side has now only won one tournament since March 2004 - a 2-1 defeat of Bangladesh, which could be seen as a disappointment as well, as the Bangladeshis had not won an ODI against a full member of the ICC, excepting Zimbabwe, since 1999. They're seventh in the ODI tables, one place ahead of the West Indies, who were in the middle of a contract dispute - meaning that they were not fielding their strongest side. However, there were a number of positive performances - the bowlers more often than not impressed, and Denesh Ramdin showed himself as a wicketkeeper for the future. However, a 7-run loss in the final match against India saw them knocked out of the final. Sri Lanka only lost one match in the tournament, a pointless fixture from their point of view against West Indies.

The inhibitor protein (IP) is situated in the mitochondrial matrix and protects the cell against rapid ATP hydrolysis during momentary ischaemia. In oxygen absence, the pH of the matrix drops. This causes IP to become protonated and change its conformation to one that can bind to the F1Fo synthetase and stops it thereby preventing it from moving in a backwards direction and hydrolyze ATP instead of make it. When oxygen is finally incorporated into the system, the pH rises and IP is deprotonated. IP dissociates from the F1Fo synthetase and allows it to resume its ATP synthesis.
	    Ini was a king at Thebes, Egypt, during the 8th century BCE.
In electronics, an injection locked frequency divider (ILFD) is a frequency divider that operates similarly to an injection locked oscillator. In an injection locked frequency divider, the frequency of the input signal is a multiple (or fraction) of the free-running frequency of the oscillator. While these frequency dividers tend to be lower power than broadband static (or flip-flop based) frequency dividers, the drawback is their low locking range. The ILFD locking range is inversely proportional to the quality factor (Q) of the oscillator tank. In integrated circuit designs, this makes an ILFD sensitive to process variations. Care must be taken to ensure the tuning range of the driving circuit (for example, a voltage-controlled oscillator) must fall within the input locking range of the ILFD.

The kidneys are complicated organs that have numerous biological roles. Their primary role is to maintain the homeostatic balance of bodily fluids by filtering and secreting metabolites (such as urea) and minerals from the blood and excreting them, along with water, as urine. Because the kidneys are poised to sense plasma concentrations of ions such as sodium, potassium, hydrogen, oxygen, and compounds such as amino acids, creatine, bicarbonate, and glucose, they are important regulators of blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and erythropoiesis (the process by which red blood cells (erythrocytes) are produced). The medical field that studies the kidneys and diseases of the kidney is called nephrology[1]. The prefix nephro- meaning kidney is from the Ancient Greek word nephros (νεφρός); the adjective renal meaning related to the kidney is from Latin rēnēs, meaning kidneys. [2]

	    This is a list of Windows games that require the XInput library from Microsoft; games that may optionally load the library should not be included on this list. XInput is used to provide native support for the Xbox 360 controller and other compatible controllers in Windows. Generally, XInput only appears with multiplatform games, presumably to simplify concurrent development of the PC and Xbox versions. The XInput package does not install to versions of Windows earlier than Windows XP with Service Pack 1.[1] This is of special interest to users of Windows 2000 and base versions of Windows XP because these operating systems are usually able to run modern Windows games that do not explicitly support them. The requirement of XInput, however, prevents games from running on these systems, regardless of whether an Xbox controller is being used. In some cases, if XInput is the only library preventing the game from running, it is possible to work around the issue by manually copying the dll into the system32 folder. The dll, which has a filename of the form xinput_1_n.dll, can be manually extracted from the DirectX CAB file found on the game disc.

Extracts were published by P. Lacroix in one volume, 1859. An incomplete edition (4 vols.) was undertaken in 1830 by Ravenal.

Mexican insurance provides coverage for tourists when they are driving in the Republic of Mexico. This type of insurance was created because U.S. insurance policies are not recognized by authorities in Mexico in the event of an accident. Because of this, the minimum insurance requirement to drive in Mexico is to have liability coverage from a Mexican underwriter.

	    Mexico is an elimination-style dice game, in which several players agree to play a set number of rounds. After each round, one player is eliminated. When all players but one have been eliminated, the remaining player wins the game. Owing to its extremely simple play-structure, it is generally pursued as a method of gambling, whereby the final remaining player wins the amount of money wagered by each person who was eliminated in earlier rounds. A variant of the drinking game liar's dice known as Mexican or Mia uses similar dice rolls, but has very different game mechanics.

The MG-13 (shortened from German Maschinenengewehr 13) was a German general purpose machine gun obtained by rebuilding a World War 1 water-cooled machine gun into an air-cooled version. The MG-13 was introduced into Wehrmacht service in 1930, where it served as the standard light machine gun. It was superseded by cheaper, faster firing models: The MG-34 and then later the MG-42. It was officially withdrawn from service in 1934 and most of them were sold off to Portugal who used it into the late 1940s as the Metralhadora Dreyse m/938. Those MG-13s that were not sold were placed into storage instead, and these later saw use in World War II by second line German units.

This family represents the microRNA (miRNA) precursors mir-2 and mir-13 (MIPF0000049). mir-2 has now been predicted or experimentally confirmed in a wide range of species. The miRNAs are transcribed as ~70 nucleotide precursors and subsequently processed by the Dicer enzyme to give a ~22 nucleotide product. In this case the mature sequence comes from the 3' arm of the precursor. The extents of the hairpin precursors are not generally known and are estimated based on hairpin prediction. The products are thought to have regulatory roles through complementarity to mRNA. The involvement of Dicer in miRNA processing suggests a relationship with the phenomenon of RNA interference. miRNAs are numbered based on the mature sequence. This family also contains the mir-13 precursor which, despite giving rise to a distinct mature sequence appears to be related in sequence.

	    Digital mixes (also known as mix networks) were invented by David Chaum in the early 1980s. Digital mixes create hard-to-trace communications by using a chain of proxy servers. Each message is encrypted to each proxy using public key cryptography; the resulting encryption is layered like a Russian doll (except that each "doll" is of the same size) with the message as the innermost layer. Each proxy server strips off its own layer of encryption to reveal where to send the message next. If all but one of the proxy servers are compromised by the tracer, untraceability can still be achieved against some weaker adversaries.

Moon magic is the belief that working rituals at the time of different phases of the moon can bring about physical or psychological change or transformation. These rituals have historically occurred on or around the full moon and to a lesser extent the new moon. Such practices are common amongst adherents of pagan, wiccan and witchcraft systems. Witches in Greek and Roman literature, particularly those from Thessaly, were regularly accused of "drawing down the moon" by use of a magic spell. The trick serves to demonstrate their powers (Virgil Eclogues 8.69), to perform a love spell (Suetonius Tiberius 1.8.21) or to extract a magical juice from the moon (Apuleius Metamorphoses 1.3.1). These beliefs would seem to be consistent with many other cultures traditions, for instance; casting of the i ching is often done during the full moon's apex.

Murexide (NH4C8H4N5O6, or C8H5N5O6.NH3), also called ammonium purpurate or MX, is the ammonium salt of purpuric acid. It may be prepared by heating alloxantin in ammonia gas to 100° C, or by boiling uramil with mercury oxide. W.N. Hartley found considerable difficulty in obtaining specimens of murexide sufficiently pure to give concordant results when examined by means of their absorption spectra, and consequently devised a new method of preparation for murexide. In this process alloxantin is dissolved in a large excess of boiling absolute alcohol, and dry ammonia gas is passed into the solution for about three hours. The solution is then filtered from the precipitated murexide, which is washed with absolute alcohol and dried. The salt obtained in this way is in the anhydrous state. It may also be prepared by digesting alloxan with alcoholic ammonia at about 78° C; the purple solid so formed is easily soluble in water, and the solution produced is indistinguishable from one of murexide.

Native Command Queuing (NCQ) is a technology designed to increase performance of SATA hard disks under certain situations by allowing the individual hard disk to internally optimize the order in which received read and write commands are executed. This can reduce the amount of unnecessary drive head movement, resulting in increased performance (and slightly decreased wear of the drive) for workloads where multiple simultaneous read/write requests are outstanding, most often occurring in server-type applications. However, the current (as of 2004) technology actually slows down HD access in certain applications, like games and sequential reads &amp; writes, because of the added latency induced by NCQ logic.[1][obsolete fact]

Several executives in large businesses receive a salary of one dollar. In place of a salary, the executives receive stock options. This approach reduces personal tax liability because, under current U.S. tax law, salary income is taxed at a significantly higher rate (currently up to 35%) than the capital gains tax (currently a maximum of 15%) applied to profits arising from the sale of stock grants. Obtaining remuneration through stock instead of salary is a common extrinsic rewarding technique which ties management performance to financial benefits. Furthermore, it acts as a tax minimization strategy.

The Pollard script, also known as Pollard Miao, is an abugida loosely based on the Latin alphabet and invented by Methodist missionary Sam Pollard. Pollard invented the script for use with A-Hmao, one of several dialects of the Hmong language. The script underwent a series of revisions until 1936, when a translation of the New Testament was published using it. The introduction of Christian materials in the script that Pollard invented caused a great impact among the Lisu. Part of the reason was that they had a legend about how their ancestors had possessed a script but lost it. According to the legend, the script would be brought back some day. When the script was introduced, many Lisu came from far away to see and learn it (Enwall 1994).

The Polymoog is a polyphonic analog synthesizer that was manufactured by Moog Music from 1975 to 1980. The Polymoog was based on divide-down oscillator technology similar to organs and string synthesizers of the time, and this led to a certain lack of flexibility compared to later polyphonic synthesizers such as the Yamaha CS-80 and the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5. The polyphonic moog has velocity sensitive keys. Coupled with a reputation for unreliabilty due to its overly-complex design and fragile construction, the Polymoog quickly became outclassed and even derided in many circles. Nevertheless both versions are capable of making some unique and exceedingly powerful sounds and they should not be dismissed.

Pulse-coupled networks or Pulse-Coupled Neural Networks (PCNNs) are neural models proposed by modeling a cat’s visual cortex and developed for high-performance biomimetic image processing. In 1989, Eckhorn introduced a neural model to emulate the mechanism of cat’s visual cortex. The Eckhorn model provided a simple and effective tool for studying small mammal’s visual cortex, and was soon recognized as having significant application potential in image processing. In 1994, the Eckhorn model was adapted to be an image processing algorithm by Johnson, who termed this algorithm Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (PCNN). Over the past decade, PCNNs have been utilized for a variety of image processing applications, including: image segmentation, feature generation, face extraction, motion detection, region growing, noise reduction, and so on.

A quilt is a type of bedding— a bed covering composed of a quilt top, a layer of batting, and a layer of fabric for backing, generally combined using the technique of quilting. Another technique for securing the quilt layers is tying. Tying refers to the technique of using thread, yarn or ribbon to pass through all three layers of the quilt at regular intervals. These "ties" hold the layers together during use and especially when the quilt is washed. This method is easier and more forgiving if the quilt is made by hand. Tied quilts are called, depending on the regional area, "lap", "comfort" or "comforter", among other names. Many quilts are made with decorative designs; some quilts are not used as bed covering at all, but are rather made to be hung on a wall or otherwise displayed. In British English, quilt is another way of saying duvet, wadding is another way of saying batting, and calico refers to muslin rather than to a fabric with a printed pattern on it.

	    Ringxiety is a portmanteau neologism formed from the words "ringtone" and "anxiety." It was first coined by David Laramie, a doctoral student at the California School of Professional Psychology, whose dissertation concerned the effects of cell phones on behavior. Ringxiety is described as the sensation and the false belief that one can hear his or her mobile phone ringing or feel it vibrating, when in fact the telephone is not doing so. Other terms for this concept include phantom ring effect and fauxcellarm. It can also be generalized to describe the sensation of hearing one's phone or doorbell ring while doing such things as taking a shower, watching television, or using a noisy device. The reasoning for this relates partially to the idea that humans are particularly sensitive to auditory tones between 1,000 and 6,000 hertz, and basic mobile phone ringers often fall within this range. This frequency range can generally be more difficult to locate spatially, thus allowing for potential confusion when heard from a distance. False vibrations are less well understood, however, and could have psychological or neurological sources.

	    In geotechnical engineering, the first major rock mass classification system was proposed about 60 years ago for tunnelling with steel support. Later classification systems were developed for non-steel support underground excavation, slope and foundation engineering. Considering the three main design approaches for excavation in rock – analytical, observational and empirical – the most predominant design approach is the empirical design method. Indeed, on many underground or surface construction and mining projects, rock mass classifications have been providing the only systematic design aid in an otherwise haphazard "trial-and-error" procedure.

The Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.9 (Blériot Experimental) was a British prototype reconnaissance aircraft of World War I. The intention of the designers was to provide the B.E.2 then in service with a forward field of fire. This was achieved by adding a small wooden box (which soon gained the nickname "pulpit") in front of the aircraft's propeller, which would accommodate a gunner armed with a Lewis gun on a trainable mount. This design had the unfortunate outcome of drawing anything loose on the gunner (including his limbs when swinging the gun around to track enemy aircraft) into the propeller blades. Needless to say, this concept was not developed further and was soon rendered superfluous by the invention of the interrupter gear. Only a single prototype was built (serial 6800), but it was tested in the field by No. 16 Squadron RFC. In his memoirs, Lt Duncan Grinnell-Milne recalls his gratitude that initial combat experience with the type proved inconclusive and that the type was not therefore ordered into mass production.

	    Rustle noise is noise consisting of aperiodic pulses characterized by the average time between those pulses (such as the mean time interval between clicks of a Geiger counter), known as rustle time (Schouten&#160;?). Rustle time is determined by the fineness of sand, seeds, or shot in rattles, contributes heavily to the sound of sizzle cymbals, drum snares, drum rolls, and string drums, and makes subtle differences in string instrument sounds. Rustle time in strings is affected by different weights and widths of bows and by types of hair and rosin in strings. The concept is also applicable to flutter-tonguing, brass and woodwind growls, resonated vocal fry in woodwinds, and eructation sounds in some woodwinds. Robert Erickson suggests the exploration of accelerando-ritardando scales producible on some acoustic instruments and further variations in rustle noise "because this apparently minor aspect of musical sounds has a disproportionately large importance for higher levels--textures, ensemble timbres, [and] contrasts between music events." (Erickson 1975, p.71-72)

	    Saint Petersburg Theatre Arts Academy, located in the very centre of the city, was established in 1779 and is the oldest and largest institution of its kind in Russia that trains and educates every possible professional needed in the field of contemporary theatre. During over two hundred years of history, the Academy evolved from realistic traditions of the Emperor's Theatre School to Vsevolod Meyerhold's workshop, world renowned stage director and faculty member of the Academy in the late teens of the XX century. Nowadays the Academy's principal approach is mainly based on Stanislavsky System, especially Method of Physical Actions and Method of Action Analysis, his later theatre technique, well known in Russia, however, not widespread overseas; system of actor's training also includes Meyerhold's Bio-mechanics. Thus, with true respect for classical school - a distinctive feature of Saint Petersburg's cultural landscape overall - the Academy manages to combine it with contemporary innovations based on main achievements of the Russian theatre in the 20th century. This is a unique feature of the Academy that majority of its faculty are working professionals, half being leading actors and artistic directors of the main Saint Petersburg theatres. This way the Academy remains in touch with current trends and skill requirements of a today theatre.

	    In physical theories, a test particle is an idealized model of an object whose physical properties (usually mass, charge, or size) are assumed to be negligible except for the property being studied, which is considered to be insufficient to alter the behavior of the rest of the system. The concept of a test particle often simplifies problems, and can provide a good approximation for physical phenomena. In addition to its uses in the simplification of the dynamics of a system in particular limits, it is also used as a diagnostic in computer simulations of physical processes.

The Bible and homosexuality is a contentious subject that influences how homosexuality and homosexual sex are regarded in societies where Christianity has made a strong impact. The Bible is generally considered by believers to be inspired by God or to record God's relationship with humanity or the nation of Israel. Some Christians view the Bible as fallible, perhaps being in part divinely inspired, but suffering from the shortcomings resulting from being written, censored, translated, and revised by humans who wrote down the prior oral traditions. Conservative Christianity sees the original texts of the Bible as inerrant, or at least infallible, regardless of the many versions due to differing translations, interpretations, additions and omissions; as the literal word of God. Some Christians, along with many non-Christians, see the Bible as mythology, purely symbolic or didactic folklore, which contains irrelevant and obsolete morality. The Eastern Orthodox Church regards the Bible as the deposit of the Apostolic Tradition, handed down from the Apostles who had personally known Jesus Christ.
Stories from the Bible have frequently been used as a basis for films. It is attractive subject matter for filmmakers for several reasons: 1) The Bible has a large potential audience of interested Christians willing to buy tickets. 2)A story is from the Bible adds an element of gravitas and respectability that many filmmakers crave. 3)The Bible is in the public domain and can freely be used by filmmakers.

In physics and physical chemistry, the thermodynamic limit is reached as the number of particles (atoms or molecules) in a system N approaches infinity — or in practical terms, one mole or Avogadro's number ≈ 6&#160;x&#160;1023. The thermodynamic behavior of a system is asymptotically approximated by the results of statistical mechanics as N&#160;→&#160;∞, and calculations using the various ensembles converge. Theoretically, this concerns manipulating factorials arising from Boltzmann's formula for the entropy, S&#160;=&#160;k&#160;log&#160;W, by using Stirling's approximation, which is justified only when applied to large numbers. But it probably has an empirical basis as well. Ordinary thermodynamics may not apply to collections of only a few atoms or molecules.
